# travelmor_budget
A lightweight travel budgeting app that helps you track your spending over the course of a trip.

## Description
This is a practice project I made to help keep track of spending while traveling. It comes equipped with graphs and various widgets to help the user track their spending for a period of time. It's not optimized for long term budgeting, however, any period of time up to a year are stable. Included with the project is a library of foreign currencies connected to Fixer API——a currency exchange api powered by 15+ exchange rate data sources——in order to update currency rates. There is also a feature to download all your expenses to CSV or PDF format.

## Technologies
This is the front end repo for the project. It's powered by React, Redux, and Material UI. The backend is written in Django.

## Project Status
This is a learning project so it will likely be worked on perodically for the forseeable future.
