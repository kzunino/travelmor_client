          Travelmor is an idea created after four years of periodic backpacking
          around South America. In order to prepare for an extended journey, I
          always saved a sum of money and then divided my money by the amount of
          days I had planned on traveling in order to get an average daily
          budget. What I could have used was a very simple budget calculator
          that let me input my spending to keep an eye on my finances without
          all complicated bells and whistles.

          My name is Kyle Zunino and I am from the San Francisco Bay Area. After
          graduating from college I decided to save money and go on a long
          backpacking journey through Latin America. To prepare for this
          adventure, I saved up a chunk of change and calculated out how much I
          could spend every day for six months in order to stay within my
          budget. So I made a mental note and tried to live within my daily
          means; however, some days it was impossible because I had large
          expenses like becoming PADI certified or paying guides to take me
          mountain biking 250 kilometers across Mexico. So I constantly found
          myself recounting how much I had spent from my overall budget and
          recalculating my new daily budget. Could I have used excel? Of course,
          but I didn't have a computer. <br />
          <br />
          Fast forward a couple more years: I had decided to live in Peru and
          Colombia for an extended amount of time to learn Spanish. I found
          myself budgeting the exact same way even though my traveling style had
          changed. What I wanted was a light weight, easy way to either input
          everything I bought for the day or just add in how much I spent
          overall. So I came up with the idea of Travelmor.
